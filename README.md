# LANE SEGMENTATION 


The global market for self-driving cars has been on a rise with the market size projected to grow from 20.3 million units in 2021 to 62.4 million units by 2030, a CAGR on 13.3%. Among the many challenges associated with designing self-driving cars, one challenge that we are particularly interested in is designing a machine learning model that can accurately detect road lanes. In this project we are creating an image segmentation model that tries to accurately identify the pixels corresponding to the road from a given dash cam image. Hence we did Lane Segmentation.
